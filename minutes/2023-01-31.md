## Minutes
Registration & Certification interface CIP
- Simon: Bruno would like to invite developers to discuss a cip for registration & audit records related to dApps.https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/355/files - Though there is a substantial update coming - one key improvement is about creating a clear path for revisions & updates.
- Ben: How does Parameterization play into this? we can have infinitely many scripts that may fit into an audited artifact by way of parameterization.
- Simon: We'll take that under advisement, though the solution isn't currently obvious.

Certification Procedure & Testing
- Romain: We're working toward an automated tool that will automatically check against a model and ensure certain universal properties, there were several original properties and we're looking at potentially adding checks like double-satisfaction.
- Ben: is there support for general Untyped Plutus Core scripts, or only PlutusTx Sourcecode
- Romain: We assume plutusTx sourcecode, and that it can be built with nix.
