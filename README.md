# Developer-Experience-Working-Group

Welcome to the Cardano Developer Experience Working Group.

## What does the developer experience working group do?

We're a community-driven group dedicated to identifying and presenting potential solutions to developer experience problems that span the Cardano ecosystem. Once a potential solution is identified, we work with actors in the ecosystem to find sponsorship to implement a solution.

We meet every Tuesday at 3:30PM/15h30m UTC.

We also use Github for discussions and the IOHK Developer Discord.

## What kind of issues fall under developer experience?
- Key barriers to adopting or being productive when developing against Cardano, as either offchain statistics or onchain dApp
- Missing/Inadequate tooling or key workflow issues when composing tools to build an end-to-end dApp
- Documentation
- multi-language/multi-ecosystem tie-in (What are the added problems when building on Mobile, embedded systems, Unity/C#, Python or javascript ecosystems)
- Best practices and default dApp architectures.

## How can I get involved?
